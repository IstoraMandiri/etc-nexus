# Mission: reporter

**Agent Name:** reporter
**Deployment:** Cloud infrastructure
**Start Command:** `/pickup reporter`

## Primary Objective

Monitor the parallel test runs and compile comprehensive multi-client test reports when complete.

## Context

Two test suites are running in parallel on cloud infrastructure after being interrupted by a power outage on 2026-01-30 ~22:30 UTC:

**Test Run 1: core-geth `legacy-cancun`**
- Agent: **test-geth**
- Total: 111,983 tests
- Resumed from: 37,944 (33.9%)
- Duration: ~26-27 hours
- ETC-relevant: ~27,000 tests (Istanbul + Berlin)

**Test Run 2: besu-etc `legacy`**
- Agent: **test-besu**
- Total: 32,616 tests
- Resumed from: 9,788 (30.0%)
- Duration: ~6-8 hours
- ETC-relevant: 32,616 (100%)

## Your Mission

### Phase 1: Monitoring (While Tests Run)

1. **Periodic Status Checks**
   - Check SITREP.md every 2-4 hours for updates from test-geth and test-besu
   - Verify both agents are making progress
   - Alert user if either test run appears stalled

2. **Track Milestones**
   - besu-etc `legacy` expected to complete first (~6-8h)
   - core-geth `legacy-cancun` completes later (~26-27h)

### Phase 2: Analysis (When Tests Complete)

3. **besu-etc Analysis** (After test-besu completes)
   - Use `/report besu-etc-legacy-results`
   - Compare with core-geth baseline (99.94% pass rate, 32,595/32,616)
   - Identify any besu-specific failures
   - Determine if besu-etc is viable for multi-client testing
   - Add entry to Operation Log

4. **core-geth Istanbul/Berlin Analysis** (After test-geth completes)
   - Use `/report core-geth-legacy-cancun-results`
   - Extract Istanbul + Berlin results from full `legacy-cancun` suite
   - Calculate pass rates for ETC-relevant forks
   - Identify any new failures beyond CREATE2 issues
   - Add entry to Operation Log

5. **Multi-Client Comparison Report**
   - Use `/report multi-client-consensus-validation`
   - Compare core-geth vs besu-etc on `legacy` suite
   - Summarize readiness for ECIP testing
   - Recommend next steps

### Phase 3: Next Steps Planning

6. **Update TODO.md**
   - Add next test suites to run (GraphQL, sync, devp2p/eth)
   - Add nethermind and fukuii client integration tasks
   - Add ECIP-1120/1121 implementation planning

## Working Directory

`/workspaces/nexus`

## Key Skills to Use

- `/hive-progress` - Check test progress
- `/report <topic>` - Create structured reports
- `/sync-docs` - Update documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Both test runs monitored to completion
- [ ] besu-etc `legacy` results analyzed and reported
- [ ] core-geth `legacy-cancun` results analyzed (Istanbul/Berlin extracted)
- [ ] Multi-client comparison report created
- [ ] All reports added to `reports/` directory
- [ ] SITREP.md Operation Log updated with all completions
- [ ] TODO.md updated with next steps
- [ ] User has clear summary of multi-client test validation status

## Coordination

- **test-geth**: Provides core-geth `legacy-cancun` results
- **test-besu**: Provides besu-etc `legacy` results
- You synthesize both into actionable reports and recommendations

## Timeline

- **Hours 0-8**: Monitor besu-etc progress, prepare for first report
- **Hours 8-12**: Analyze besu-etc results, create first report
- **Hours 12-27**: Monitor core-geth progress
- **Hours 27-30**: Analyze core-geth results, create multi-client report
- **Hours 30+**: Update planning documents, prepare for next phase

## Expected Deliverables

1. `reports/260131_BESU_ETC_LEGACY_RESULTS.md` - besu-etc legacy suite analysis
2. `reports/260131_CORE_GETH_ISTANBUL_BERLIN.md` - Istanbul/Berlin results from legacy-cancun
3. `reports/260131_MULTI_CLIENT_VALIDATION.md` - Comprehensive multi-client comparison
4. Updated SITREP.md Operation Log entries
5. Updated TODO.md with next phase planning
