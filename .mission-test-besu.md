# Mission: test-besu

**Agent Name:** test-besu
**Deployment:** Cloud infrastructure
**Start Command:** `/pickup test-besu`

## Primary Objective

Resume the interrupted `legacy` consensus test suite for besu-etc client.

## Context

On 2026-01-30 ~22:30 UTC, a power outage interrupted the besu-etc test run. You are now deployed on reliable cloud infrastructure to complete this test suite.

**Test Run Details:**
- Suite: `legacy` (Constantinople and earlier forks)
- Total tests: 32,616
- Progress at interruption: 9,788 / 32,616 (30.0%)
- ETC-relevant: 32,616 (100% - all pre-Constantinople)

**Why this matters:** This validates that besu-etc correctly implements all ETC forks up through Constantinople. Core-geth already achieved 99.94% pass rate on this suite (32,595/32,616). We need besu-etc results for multi-client validation.

**besu-etc Client:** Hyperledger Besu configured for Ethereum Classic using native ETC fork support. Created in previous session with custom `mapper.jq` for ETC forks (Atlantis, Agharta, Phoenix, Thanos, Magneto, Mystique, Spiral).

## Your Mission

1. **Resume Test Run**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/nexus/hive
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ./hive --sim ethereum/consensus --sim.limit legacy --client besu-etc
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Use `/hive-progress --update` to check and update SITREP.md
   - Use `/hourly-monitor` for automated hourly updates
   - Typical rate: ~50-60 tests/min (Besu is slightly slower than core-geth)
   - Estimated completion: ~6-8 hours for remaining tests

3. **When Complete**
   - Compare results with core-geth baseline (99.94% pass rate)
   - Identify any besu-specific failures
   - Update SITREP.md Operation Log with completion entry
   - Create summary report comparing core-geth vs besu-etc
   - Coordinate with **reporter** agent for final analysis

## Key Context

- Cloud instance verified: smoke tests passing (6/6 genesis, 2/2 network)
- Core-geth baseline: 32,595/32,616 passed (99.94%)
- Core-geth failures: 21 CREATE2 collision tests (EIP-7610 edge cases - expected)
- besu-etc client location: `hive/clients/besu-etc/` (commit `271ae4c`)
- See SITREP.md Operation Log for besu-etc creation details

## Working Directory

`/workspaces/nexus/hive`

## Expected Duration

~6-8 hours to complete remaining tests (22,828 tests at ~50-60 tests/min)

## Coordination

- **test-geth**: Running parallel test suite for core-geth client (`legacy-cancun`)
- **reporter**: Will compile final multi-client test report when both complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test suite completes without infrastructure failures
- [ ] Results logged and analyzed
- [ ] SITREP.md updated with completion status
- [ ] Results compared with core-geth baseline
- [ ] Any besu-specific failures investigated
- [ ] Report created for multi-client comparison
- [ ] Besu-etc validated as viable second ETC client for Hive testing
