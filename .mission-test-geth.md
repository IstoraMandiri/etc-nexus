# Mission: test-geth

**Agent Name:** test-geth
**Deployment:** Cloud infrastructure
**Start Command:** `/pickup test-geth`

## Primary Objective

Resume the interrupted `legacy-cancun` consensus test suite for core-geth client.

## Context

On 2026-01-30 ~22:30 UTC, a power outage interrupted the core-geth test run. You are now deployed on reliable cloud infrastructure to complete this test suite.

**Test Run Details:**
- Suite: `legacy-cancun` (Istanbul through Cancun forks)
- Total tests: 111,983
- Progress at interruption: 37,944 / 111,983 (33.9%)
- Passed: 37,908
- Failed: 36 (CREATE2 collision tests - expected, see Operation Log in SITREP.md)
- ETC-relevant: ~27,000 tests (Istanbul + Berlin)

**Why this matters:** We need to validate that core-geth correctly implements Istanbul and Berlin forks, which are part of the ETC roadmap. The full suite includes later forks (not relevant to ETC), but we need the baseline to identify which tests matter.

## Your Mission

1. **Resume Test Run**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/nexus/hive
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ./hive --sim ethereum/consensus --sim.limit legacy-cancun --client core-geth
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Use `/hive-progress --update` to check and update SITREP.md
   - Use `/hourly-monitor` for automated hourly updates
   - Typical rate: ~70 tests/min
   - Estimated completion: ~26-27 hours for remaining tests

3. **When Complete**
   - Analyze results
   - Update SITREP.md Operation Log with completion entry
   - Create summary report of Istanbul/Berlin test results (ETC-relevant subset)
   - Coordinate with **reporter** agent for final analysis

## Key Context

- Cloud instance verified: smoke tests passing (6/6 genesis, 2/2 network)
- CREATE2 failures are expected (EIP-7610 edge cases, safe to exclude from ETC)
- See SITREP.md for full cloud setup process
- See Operation Log in SITREP.md for resolved issues

## Working Directory

`/workspaces/nexus/hive`

## Expected Duration

~26-27 hours to complete remaining tests (74,039 tests at ~70 tests/min)

## Coordination

- **test-besu**: Running parallel test suite for besu-etc client
- **reporter**: Will compile final multi-client test report when both complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test suite completes without infrastructure failures
- [ ] Results logged and analyzed
- [ ] SITREP.md updated with completion status
- [ ] ETC-relevant subset identified (Istanbul + Berlin)
- [ ] Report created for Istanbul/Berlin results
